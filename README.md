ML From Scratch

A collection of 23 Machine Learning models including:

  1. Mathematical formulation and model description and application (latex, diagrams)
  2. Model from scratch, tested with public data. (Python 3.7)
  3. Model using libraries tested with public data. Pros and cons of each library. (Python updated libraries)
  4. Tensorflow model tested with public data (Tensorflow 2.0)
  
Most models are based in other open sources in different sites, these are recognized in the last section Credits and Links. Every model has been updated to Python 3.7, Tensorflow 2.0 and updated libraries so the code could be slightly different than the sources. Several sources are combined in some models and every source is listed on the Credits section.

The aim of this is putting altogether the most relevant ML models and go end to end on each of them from mathematical formulation to scalable models and applications. Hope this helps, particularly new data scientists to understand from the ground each model. Strong fundations lead to correct application and better results. Any comments/corrections/contributions are welcome. Enjoy!
