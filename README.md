ML From Scratch

A collection of 23 Machine Learning models including:

  1. Mathematical formulation and model description and application (latex, diagrams)
  2. Model from scratch, tested with public data. (Python 3.7)
  3. Model using libraries tested with public data. Pros and cons of each library. (Python updated libraries)
  4. Tensorflow model tested with public data (Tensorflow 2.0)
  
Most models are based in other open sources in different sites, these are recognized in the last section Credits and Links. Every model has been updated to Python 3.7, Tensorflow 2.0 and updated libraries so the code could be slightly different than the sources. Mathematical formulae was added when not included on the sources. Some models are a combination of different sources and every source is listed on the Credits section. 

The aim of this repository is just putting altogether the most relevant ML models and have the same structure on each of them from mathematical formulation to scalable models and applications. Hope this helps, particularly new data scientists to understand from the ground each model. Strong fundations lead to correct application and better results. Any comments/corrections/contributions are welcome. Enjoy!
