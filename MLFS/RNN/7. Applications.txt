Applications

RNNs can be used in a lot of different places. Following are a few examples where a lot of RNNs are used.

1. Language Modelling and Generating Text
Given a sequence of word, here we try to predict the likelihood of the next word. This is useful for translation since the most likely sentence would be the one that is correct.

2. Machine Translation
Translating text from one language to other uses one or the other form of RNN. All practical day systems use some advanced version of a RNN.

3. Speech Recognition
Predicting phonetic segments based on input sound waves, thus formulating a word.

4. Generating Image Descriptions
A very big use case is to understand what is happening inside an image, thus we have a good description. This works in a combination of CNN and RNN. CNN does the segmentation and RNN then used the segmented data to recreate the description. It’s rudimentary but the possibilities are limitless.

5. Video Tagging
This can be used for video search where we do image description of a video frame by frame.
